# Next.js: Creating and Hosting a Full-Stack Site


Many web developers focus solely on one part of an application: the front end, the back end, the database, or the hosting platform. However, JavaScript has become such a pervasive language that it can be used for all of these parts. This means that a single JavaScript developer can now create an entire web application, a task that used to require an entire team. In this course, full-stack development instructor Shaun Wassell shows developers how to do exactly that by using Next.js to build a full-stack application. Find out how to build basic React interfaces in Next.js, add back-end functionality to Next.js applications, make network requests, and finally host a full-stack Next.js application so that anyone can use it.
